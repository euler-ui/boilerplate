### Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version of common-fe-template on your
local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/euler-ui/boilerplate.git FooApp
$ cd FooApp
$ rm -rf .git
```

#### 2. Run `npm install`
This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](./package.json) file.

#### 3. Run `npm start`
This command will build the app into webpack bundles. As soon as the build completes, it will start a webpack dev server.
