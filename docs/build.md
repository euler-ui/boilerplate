### cd to Foo.

### Run `npm run prod`
The command will generate all static files into build folder.

### You can test the build by run 'npm run start:prod'
The command will bring up a node server which servers all static files under build foler. Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). If it works well, you'll see the page runs up.
